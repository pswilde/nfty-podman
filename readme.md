# This is a simple Podman setup script for the Nfty Notification service

This script will initialize a podman pod with required containers to run your own
instance of the [Nfty Notification](https://nfty.sh) service.  

Very little setup is required - mainly in the `config/server.yml` directory to configure your `base-url`  

You will need to set up your own Reverse Proxy and TLS certificates
